# Deep-Learning


| Project Name | Description | Libraries | Technique |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Lending Club Loan Data Analysis](https://github.com/Dheeraj-M1/DeepLearning/tree/main/Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis) | The code performs a loan default analysis using Lending Club Loan Data. It uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code starts by loading the loan data into a Pandas DataFrame and checking for missing data. <br>Next, it performs exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, including filling missing values, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding. Finally, the code trains and evaluates machine learning models including ExtraTreesClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and MLPClassifier to predict loan default. The results are evaluated using cross-validation techniques and visualized using data visualization techniques. | Pandas, Numpy, SKlearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Cross-Validation, Data Visualization |
| [Perform Facial Recognition with Deep Learning in Keras](https://github.com/Dheeraj-M1/DeepLearning/tree/main/Perform%20Facial%20Recognition%20with%20Deep%20Learning%20in%20Keras%20Using%20CNN) | I successfully performed facial recognition using the Keras library. I started by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow and keras. Then, I loaded the ORL_faces dataset from .npz file and normalized the data. The data was then split into training and validation sets and reshaped for input into the model. The target data was also converted to categorical format.<br> I visualized the images in grey and autumn colormaps to check their representation.  Next, I built the model using a Sequential model in Keras. I added multiple Conv2D layers, MaxPooling2D layers, and Dropout layers to the model, along with a Flatten layer and Dense layers for prediction. I used the LeakyReLU activation function and Adam optimizer. Finally, I compiled the model and trained it on the prepared data. | Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, SKlearn | Deep Learning, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation |

| Project Name | Description | Libraries | Technique |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Network Routing and Graph Paths](https://github.com/Dheeraj-M1/Algorithm_Design) | The code imports the csv and pandas library, as well as the numpy and random libraries. Then, it reads a file called "Amazon0302.txt" and creates a dataframe, with the first two columns labeled "source" and "target". A third column "weight" is added to the dataframe with random values in the range of 1 to 100. The dataframe is then saved to a file named "Edge_weight.txt". The code then defines a function to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and uses this to find the shortest path between all unique "target" nodes and a specific source node (2). <br>The data is read from a file named "Edge_weight.txt" and stored in a Pandas dataframe. The data is then manipulated to create a dictionary of edges with their corresponding weights, which is used in the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. The shortest path and the distances between nodes are calculated and stored in a list called "a". The code prints the shortest path for each unique "target" node. | Pandas, random, pyplot, sorted, Numpy | Reading the Data, Data Manupulation, Data Export, Data Visualization |
