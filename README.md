| 🛍 [Lending Club Loan Data Analysis]([https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udemy-Advanced-MySQL](https://github.com/Dheeraj-M1/DeepLearning/tree/main/Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis)) | I analyse and optimise marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance and use data to understand impact of new product and campaign launches for an online retailer. | Advanced SQL |  
|
|[Lending Club Loan Data Analysis](https://github.com/Dheeraj-M1/DeepLearning/tree/main/Lending-Club-Loan-Data-Analysis)| The code performs a loan default analysis using Lending Club Loan Data. It uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code starts by loading the loan data into a Pandas DataFrame and checking for missing data. Next, it performs exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, including filling missing values, feature scaling, and one-hot encoding. Finally, the code trains and evaluates machine learning models including ExtraTreesClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and MLPClassifier to predict loan default. The results are evaluated using cross-validation techniques and visualized using data visualization techniques. |
